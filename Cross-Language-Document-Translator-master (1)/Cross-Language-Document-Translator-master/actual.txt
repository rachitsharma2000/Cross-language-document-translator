Why is the smoking ban not being enforced in designated areas of the building?
It is absolutely unacceptable that we approve legislation and that we do not comply with it ourselves.
Mrs Lynne, you are absolutely right. I will check whether this has indeed happened.
I will continue to refer the matter to the College of Quaestors. I am convinced that our Quaestors will ensure that the legislation that we have voted on is actually complied with.
Madam President, Mrs Díez González and I had asked a number of questions together in response to certain statements by Commissioner de Palacio in a Spanish newspaper.
The services responsible for the agenda did not put those questions on the agenda, since those questions would have already been answered in another part-session.
As this is not the case, I request that the relevant decision be reconsidered.
The questions that have been answered earlier relate to Mrs de Palacio's contribution to a different file and do not concern the statements that appeared in the ABC newspaper on 18 November.
My dear colleague, we will check all this.
I must confess that I find the situation somewhat confusing now.
